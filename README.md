# SimHub-Sketches

## Extended sketch
#### Merges all added features that are in separated sketches into a single master sketch. Highly advise using this for maximum compatibility

## PaddleClutch sketch
#### Adds dual-clutch support to the SimHub arduino sketch (powered by [PaddleClutch](https://github.com/MorGuux/PaddleClutch))

## QuarterStepEncoders sketch
#### Adds quarter step encoder support to the SimHub arduino sketch (namely, CTS288). 

These encoders use a 2-bit binary code to encode their position, with each bit change representing a full change in position (every detent), as opposed to other encoders which may only use a detent every 2 or 4 positions.
